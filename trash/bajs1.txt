cjump label       ; Conditionally jumps to a label if the top value of

call label arity  ; Calls a function located in label with the
                  ; specified arity. Pushes the return address and
                  ; previous fp onto the stack. Sets fp to the first
                  ; parameter on the stack. The arity corresponds with
                  ; the number of parameters.
ret [copy]        ; Removes the call stack frame, i.e. everything
                  ; below fp is nuked, and does the same for the data
                  ; stack. Restores fp to the previous fp for both
                  ; stacks. Pushes the return value onto the callers
                  ; call stack. The copy operand is only meaningful if
                  ; the return value is a string, i.e. the string
                  ; return value's data is copied onto the callers
                  ; data stack. Jumps to the return address.
